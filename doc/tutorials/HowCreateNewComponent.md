# How Create a new component

Each component is a Rete.component class, so to create another component it is necessary to create another class that will have inputs, outputs and controls. Each class has two methods which are builder () and worker (). The builder is executed when the class is created at run time and the worker method is always executed when there are changes in the input or control.
